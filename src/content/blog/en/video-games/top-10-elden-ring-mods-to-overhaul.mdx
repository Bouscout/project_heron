Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree is very likely to drop in 2024. If you have been longing to return to the lands between but you want your experience to be different here are the top 10 mods you could use to drastically overhaul your Elden ring experience.


## 10. Easy mode

The description is in the title. Many players due to the critical success of Elden Ring have been wanting to try it, but its challenging nature has caused many to simply give up which is why this mod has been created. This mod will reduce the damage taken by the player while making his attacks stronger and with no FP cost. It multiply the number of runes the player get, raises the item discovery and a lot of other stats, in short it makes the game easy. If you want to simply enjoy the lands between without any worries or you want an easier version in order to finally beat the game, this mod is for you.

## 9. Prepare to die (hard mode)

This mod is exactly the opposite of the first one. Elden Ring is already a pretty hard game for most people, but if you need more challenge, this mod will enhance the enemy AI, extend their HP, stamina, damage, resistance and allow them to see you from farther and chase you for longer distances. It also restricts you by allowing warping only to churches and nerfing various stats. The mod aims to make the game more difficult by not just giving more HP and damage to the enemies. So if you are up for a new challenge this mod might be for you.

## 8. Item and enemies randomizer

This is a simple way to create a bit of diversity from your first playthrough. All the items and enemies would have random positions so you can't simply rely on your memory to get the best gears or the items you need to progress. I personally think this mod is best used when combined with some of the best mods.

## 7. Unlock the framerate
This is simply a quality-life mod if your computer has more power. As you know, Elden Ring caps the game framerate at 60FPS. So even if you have a very powerful rig, you would be limited unless you were to use that mod which would then remove the cap.

## 6. Start the game with 99 millions runes

In Elden Ring runes are the currency that allows you to level up your character and purchase items. In short, runes are essential to your character progression. If you were to have this amount of runes, you could max out your character stats and purchase some exceptional gears right from the get go. This mod would allow you to start the game with a character that you would need several playthroughs to reach. You can truly experience what it feels like to be OP (over powered).

## 5. Elden Ring dark moon

We are now plunging into the most ambitious mods. The dark moon mod adds several new armors, weapons, items and spells and updates the character creation engine.


It overhauls the combat system and adds new mechanics such as boss resurrection.


It even adds brand new landmarks for you to visit, overall a consequent amount of changes have been made in this mod. If you are interested in unveiling all of its secrets and experience its gameplay changes, you might be in for a good ride.

## 4. Elden ring reforged
<Image src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/elden-ring-reforged-mod-explained.jpg" />
This mod changes the game system in several aspects. It adds new combat mechanics both for the players and the enemies. It introduces a new system for progression and combat. It even adds a difficulty setting. In short this mod would change the overall mechanics of the game allowing you to explore new possibilities.

## 3. Convergence mod

The convergence mod is a pretty famous mod in the souls community. The mod has also appeared and has been praised on Dark Souls 3. It basically introduces classes and changes the progression to base it on that class system. Your class will dictate your playthrough with special items and spells while starting from different locations in the world. The mod also overhauls several dungeons in the game and adds some new bosses.


This mod adds a lot of content and truly changes your experience so you may have a very good time using this mod.

## 2. Seamless Coop
<Image src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Elden-Ring-Seamless-Coop-Mod.jpg" />
The seamless coop mod is a must have mod if you have a friend playing Elden Ring. As the name implies, it allows you to seamlessly join each other's worlds and play the game without any of the limitations of the original game. Player will always respawn at grace site, defeating the boss will no longer send your friends to their world. The map waypoints will be synchronized for every player in the session. You will truly be exploring the same world together without any limitations.


As you play with potentially 4 (four) additional friends at the same time, the mod would balance the game around that aspect and introduce a set of rules to keep everything fair and under control.


The mod allows you to add other mods as well so if you have a friend playing Elden Ring, getting the Seamless Coop mod and potentially adding another overhaul mod and jumping into it together would probably be one of the best ways to re-experience the game.

## 1. Ascended mod (extremely hard)
<Image src="https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/4333/images/thumbnails/1019/1019-1700175988-2130551091.png" />
This mode is not for the faint of hearts, the author says in the description "Only the top 5% of Players complete Ascended Mod,
Are you in the top 5%?" which announce the color.


The ascended mod will make the game extremely hard while adding a lot of new elements. It has been praised for the way it forces players to use any advantages or items they have in order to be able to beat it.


The enemies have their AI and physics changed. They are more numerous while dealing more damage, some of them become faster with faster projectiles and different status effects added to their attacks. The bosses also get some overhauls with their stats being altered and sometimes even their whole encounter adding new enemies or additional bosses.


The mod also buffs the player in different ways, but the overall experience would still stay very hard.


This mod is guaranteed to make your experience completely different forcing you to play the game in a different way altogether. Adding additional mods to this such as the item randomizer or even inviting friends with the seamless co-op mod and you are guaranteed to see Elden Ring under a totally different light.

## Conclusion
All the mods we discussed above have the potential to drastically change your game experience but what's so endearing about them is that you can totally make a combination of the mods that sound the most interesting to you and jump right into the game with their combined changes. The feeling of the first time when playing Elden Ring is magic but I hope some of these mods will help you reach something close to it.
