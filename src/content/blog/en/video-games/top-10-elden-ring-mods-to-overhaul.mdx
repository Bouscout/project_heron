Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree is very likely to drop in 2024. If you have been longing to return to the lands between but you want your experience to be different here are the top 10 mods you could use to drastically overhaul your Elden ring experience.

## 10. Easy mode

The description is in the title. Many players due to the critical success of Elden Ring have been wanting to try it, but its challenging nature has caused many to simply give up which is why this mod has been created. This mod will reduce the damage taken by the player while making his attacks stronger and with no FP cost. It multiply the number of runes the player get, raises the item discovery and a lot of other stats, in short it makes the game easy. If you want to simply enjoy the lands between without any worries or you want an easier version in order to finally beat the game, this mod is for you.

## 9. Prepare to die (hard mode)

This mod is exactly the contrary of the first one. Elden Ring is already a pretty hard game for most people, but if you need more challenge, this mod will enhance the enemy AI, extend their HP, stamina, damage, resistance and allow them to see you from farther and chase you for longer distances. It also restrict you by allowing warping only to churches and nerfing various stats. The mod aims to make the game more difficult by not just giving more HP and damage to the enemies. So if you are up for a new challenge this mod might be for you.

## 8. Item and enemies randomizer

This is a simple way create a bit of diversity from your first playthrough. All the items and enemies would have random positions so you can't simply rely on your memory to get the best gears or the items you need to progress. I personally think this mod is best used when combined with some of the best mods.

## 7. Unlock the framerate
This is simply a quality-life mod if your computer has more power. As you know, Elden Ring cap the game framerate at 60FPS. So even if you have a very powerful rig, you would be limited unless you were to use that mod which would then remove the cap.

## 6. Start the game with 99 millions runes

In Elden Ring runes are the currency that allows you to level up your character and purchase items. In short runes are essential to your character progression. If you were to have this amount of runes, you could max out your character stats and purchase some exceptional gears right from the get go. This mod would allow you to start the game with a character that you would need several playthrough to reach. You can truly experience what it feels like to be OP (over powered).

The convergence mod is a pretty famous mod in the souls community. The mod had also appeared and has been praised on Dark Souls 3. It basically introduces classes and change the progression to base it on that class system. Your class will dictate your playthrough with special items and spells while starting from different locations in the world. The mod also overhauls several dungeons in the game and add some new boss.

This mod adds a lot of content and truly changes your experience so you may have a very good time using this mod.

## 2. Seamless Coop
<Image src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Elden-Ring-Seamless-Coop-Mod.jpg" />
The seamless coop mod is a must have mod if you have a friend playing Elden Ring. As the name implies, it allows you to seamlessly join each other worlds and play the game without any of the limitation of the original game. Player will always respawn at grace site, defeating boss will no longer send your friends to their world. The map waypoints will be synchronized for every player in the session. You will truly be exploring the same world together without any limitations.

As you play with potentially 4 (four) additionnal friends at the same time, the mod would balance the game around that aspect and introduces a set of rules to keep everything fair and under control.

The mod allows you add other mod as well so if you have a friend playing Elden Ring, getting the Seamless Coop mod and potentially adding other overhaul mod and jumping into it together would be probably be one of the best way to reexperience the game.

This mode is not for the faint of hearts, the author says in the description "Only the top 5% of Players complete Ascended Mod,
Are you that top 5%?" which annonces the color.

The ascended mod will make the game extremely hard while adding a lot of new elements. It has been praised for the way it forces player to use any advantages or items they have in order to be able to beat it.

The enemies have their AI and physics changed. They are more numerous while dealing more damage, some of them becomes faster with faster projectile and different status effect added to their attacks. The bosses also get some overhauls with their stats being altered and sometimes even their whole encounter adding new enemies or additional bosses.

The mod also buffs the player in different ways, but the overall experience would still stay very hard.

This mod is guaranteed to make your experience completly different forcing you to play the game in a different way altogether. Addding additionnal mods to this such as the item randomizer or even inviting friends with the seamless coop mod and you are guaranteed to see Elden Ring under a total different light.
