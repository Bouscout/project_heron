With the announcement of the Elden Ring dlc "Shadow of the Erdtree" and [the numerous recent rumors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2023/12/17/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-release-date-leaked/?sh=6160549f5479) pointing to the closeness of the dlc realease. A lot of discussions have taken place in the community about the content of the dlc. In this article, I will present the most interesting and ambitious theories.

## What is Elden Ring
Elden ring is a massive open world game created by FromSoftware, the creator of the Dark Souls saga. It has shaken the gaming world and has gotten praise both from the critics and the players even winning the Game of the year title in 2022.

Elden ring is mostly praised thanks to its dense and rich open world subtly guiding the player to exploration with great rewards and surprises scattered all accross the maps. It builds upon the the excellent combat system of the dark souls and a wide range of items allowing the players to interact and immerse themselves deeply into the open world. Combine to that a list of numerous and excellent boss battles challenging the player to surpass itself at all time and different dungeon and castles with interesting architecture and themes to create a sense of wonder, elden ring has been a breath of good fresh air in a gaming landscape where open worlds were failing to innovate.

With such a perfect combinaison, the game had amassed a huge player base of [13 millions players](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1300663/elden-ring-sales-worldwide/) all exploring and experimenting with everything the game has to offer.

Players having finished the game countless times finally started to expand the game themselves. They created numerous challenges to finish the games in different situations such as not taking any healing or not rolling. They even created a lot of interesting mods which we cover some example in our article [best elden ring mod in 2024](#).

It is clear, we need more Elden Ring and thus the anouncement of an elden ring DLC has revived the flame of the community.

## Fromsoftware and DLCS

Fromsoftware, the studio behing elden ring ever since they have been under the leadership of Hidetaka Miyazaki has had an almost perfect portfolio with the great games such as the Dark souls sage, Sekiro and the beloved Bloodborne.

For most of these games, they have released excellent DLCs enhacing the base game in different forms (expect for Sekiro). We can clearly look at the excellent dlc of the original Dark Souls which expand profoundly in the story of a beloved character or the Dark souls 3 dlcs with the "Ringed City" dlc being my absolute favorite section in the Dark Souls saga bringing it to an impactful conclusion. 

It is safe to say that fromsoftware usually do not disappoint with their DLCS, so as fans of the Elden Ring, we are in our right mind to expect the upcoming [Shadow of the Erdtree](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/DLC) dlc to be of great quality.


## What can we expect from the Elden Ring DLC in general
Given the nature of DLC(downloadable content) which is simply additional content added to the base game and the usual treatment of fromsoftware with DLCs, there are certain points that we can totally expect from the dlc.


### 1. New weapons and items

<Image src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elden-ring-convergence-mod-best-weapons-1.jpg" alt="Weapons" caption="Weapons" />

One of the strength of the fromsoftware games is the diversity that the wide range of weapons and items bring to the game. The players have access to specific movesets depending on the weapons and that could completly affect how you play the games. A heavy sword player would privilege capitalizing on one big mistake while a short sword player could simply keep a constant pressure by attacking at small intervals. Add to that the PvP(player versus player) dimension and you considerably extand the opportunities of different interactions.

New weapons are a safe way to diversify the gameplay with new builds and new spells playing could experience the game in a totally different ways and fromsoftware have been known to add interesting weapons to DLCs, so we can expect them.

### 2. New bosses and enemies

The combat system of the fromsoftware games is only as good as the enemies that can challenge the player. Being able to dodge and give poverful well timed hit is only fun when the enemies you are fighting are forcing you into situation where you have to utilize everything the gameplay has to offer.

With that in mind, fromsoftware has made sure that their enemies and bosses challenge the player to surpass themselves often resulting in some frustration and the "hardcore" label that the fromsoftware games have. But it is undeniable that this excellent combat system is the one of the main appeal of Elden Ring, so we should be seeing new enemies and new bosses making us break more controllers as we challenge them.

### 3. New dungeons

One of the main appeal of elden ring was the big dungeon that you could explore the secrets you could find inside them, finding out the pieces of puzzle of the lore and often resulting in impressive boss battles. The biggest and most sophisticated one were called "legacy dungeons" and have always hosted the main story points and bosses in Elden Ring. If the DLC has to expand on the main game story at anypoint, then we will be guaranteed to explore a new legacy dungeon.

### 4. New landmarks

Elden ring being an open world game, the sense of discovery is a major part of its magic. Seing an intriguing building or reaching a new destination is part of what makes it so special. It is very likely that fromsoftware would want to reproduce those feelings accross the players thus we can expect some brand new landmarks on the map.

## Our wild expectations
As fan of Elden Ring and the sense of freshness and wonder that we all had during our adventures in the land between, it is very hard to supress our urges to expect the DLC to create that same sense of wonder and make our journey reach new heights. Here are some of wildest expectations that we have as fan.

### 1. New gameplay features
Elden ring introduced new gameplay features to the original dark souls formula. I can notably point to the jumping action and the horse which brought in a lot if intrisic functionnalities. In that same vein if the developer of fromsoftware could find ways to bring new gameplay mechanics in an interesting way, that would be a welcomed addition.

### 2. New map
The lands between (the world of elden ring) is huge, during your journey, whenever you pick up a piece of map shard, you simply feel dwarfed by the sheer size of the world you are exploring. If fromsoftware in order to surprise us had been working on a big map of half or more of the size of the original map while keeping the same proportional quantity and quality of content, we would surely lose our mind over the dlc.

### 3. Harder bosses

Lots of player have been challenging the bosses of elden ring, but the one that stayed in most minds were the strongest one such as Maliketh the black blade or Malenia blade of Miquella. Those bosses have made many player question their abilities and have made some legends of the internet rise such as "let me solo her" who specialized in helping player defeating Malenia with her deadly "Waterfall dance". If we could see equally or stronger boss appeared, that would be an awesome addition particulary if fromsoftware could apply their usual quality control ensuring a fair fight.

## Conclusion

There are a lot of things we have in our Elden Ring dlc wishlist, but at the end of the day those are just speculations. We simply have to take all the hints with a grain of salt and expect that fromsoftware do their usual magic and give us a wonderful experience. They have been working on the DLC for almost two(2) years which is longer than usual compared to their other dlc so we can only hope that translate into the quality of the DLC. They have given us that amazing adventure in the lands between so we can only give them our support and our trust to ensure an equally amazing experience with Shadows of the erdtree.
