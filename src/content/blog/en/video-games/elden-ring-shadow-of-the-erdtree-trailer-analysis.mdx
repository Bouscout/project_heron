Elden Ring, the colossal success from FromSoftware, renowned for its innovative take on the open-world genre infused with the Dark Souls formula, has finally unveiled a trailer for its eagerly awaited DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree.

The trailer, rich with visual and narrative cues, has sparked immense excitement and speculation within the gaming community. Here's a deep dive into what the trailer reveals and hints at for this upcoming expansion.

## Is the DLC in a new map?

The trailer presents a series of stunning, yet ominously dark landscapes, a stark contrast to the golden radiance typically associated with the Erdtree. The closing dialogue, "Come, now. Touch the withered arm, and travel to the realm of shadow," strongly suggests a journey to a new, unexplored mapâ€”the realm of shadow. This is further supported by the "map" tag found on the DLC's PlayStation Store page, indicating a fresh, expansive world awaiting players' exploration.

This approach aligns with FromSoftware's tradition, reminiscent of Dark Souls 3's DLCs, Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City, offering players vast new terrains teeming with lore, challenges, and beauty.

The trailer hints at Mogh's temple as the gateway to this new realm, inviting players to embark on a thrilling voyage into the unknown.

## New dungeons

Showcased within the trailer are glimpses of new, intricately designed dungeons that promise a departure from the familiar catacombs and minor dungeons of the base game. These new dungeons, with their unique aesthetics and atmosphere, suggest a deepening of the world's lore and an expansion of the game's rich exploratory gameplay.

## New weapons, spells, and skills

A highlight of the trailer is the array of new weapons, skills, and spells, suggesting a significant expansion of the combat and strategy elements that players have come to adore. While the trailer stops short of revealing new gameplay mechanics, the showcased arsenal promises to refresh the combat experience, potentially introducing novel ways to engage with the world and its inhabitants.

## New bosses

His exact nature and role within the DLC's narrative remain shrouded in mystery.
