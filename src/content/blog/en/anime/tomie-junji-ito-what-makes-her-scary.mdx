True fear is something we have been greatly shielded from in our current society. Some may nowadays associate it to popular monsters such as vampires and zombies and other with a more critic opinion may associate it to the unknown itself.

What if a type of fear could emerge from both the unknown and the known, that is what Junji Ito proposes us in Tomie's stories. 

## What is the story of Tomie
<Image src="https://musewithmeblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/TomieFeatured-1.jpg?w=740" />
Without getting to much in the spoiler territory, the Tomie's series follow the story a young and very attractive girl named Tomie with a very excecrable character seducing and driving mad people around her, particulary men. She is absolutely irresestible to the men which wouldn't even hesitate leaving their girlfriends for her causing great jalousy and drama all around her.

Her egocentric and narcissic personality is very prone to light the fuse on dramatic events always ending with her getting killed by the men so crazily in love with her.

Here is the twist, Tomie has been "cursed" with regenerative power similar to those of an axotl but in a way more powerful fashion. Her cut limbs and body parts can fully become new Tomies themselves which will then go on to new territories, terrorizing and driving more men mad as they let themselves lose control over her appaling personality.

A nightmarish cycle, which is pretty much unstoppable as the main factors turning the wheels are the victims themselves, that is what Tomie's stories are about.

They paint a desperate and gore picture as we witness Tomie being violently killed while causing dramatic events are around her, but underneath those dark and bloody stroke, there are other aspect of Tomie's horror, subtle, yet even more disturbing, drawing directly from something we are very familiar with, our human nature.

## The known

Something we know should normally not be scary anymore, after harnessing fire or wild animals, our ancestors no longer feared them, but could that principle be applied to everything. We know all the rules around vampires and zombies, but yet we would fear them if we were to see them.

The fear of the known, steam from the danger that thing could present to us, it certainly lost the mysterious aspect that would make us drive ourselves mad thinking about it, but it certainly would make us run away at the first sight.

Tomie isn't scary at all, in fact she is actually quite attractive which is a contrast with her monstrous nature. Looking at it from a bigger picture, Tomie is never dangerous in her stories, she never takes the initiative to use physical or any other type of direct violence.

That is the one aspect that seperate her from your typical monster, Tomie is like any other girl you could meet in the street or in a library, yet beneath that facade lies a more insidious form of horror. Her terror does not come from fangs or claws, but from the way she can convey powerful emotions through simple human interactions, something we are very familiar with.

Tomie's is like the worst nightmare for any men. Picture yourself in the shoes of a man passing by that girl. Her irresestible beauty would certainly take you to her and try to earn her favor and attention. While you are trying your best, her narcissic and egocentric side would make you question your worth and self-estem and you end up desperatly trying to please her. You become emprisonned in a cycle of effort in order to get her validation until the point where she takes an unreasonable decision or try to leave after everything you've poored in.

You find yourself in a situation where it's not conceivable to let her go anymore. She will then start mocking and humiliating you which will then end up in you violently killing her.

Tomie is a form of terror men are well aware of, but still end up falling for even in our actual society.
