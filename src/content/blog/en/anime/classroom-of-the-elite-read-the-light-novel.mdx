## What is Classroom of the elite
Classroom of the elite is a psychological school-life anime and manga series adapted from the light novel of the same name. It follows the story of Ayanokoji in an elitist high school where student have to compete in different aspect in order to graduate from the highest position, the class A. The season three (3) of the anime is actually airing this winter on different anime streaming platform such as crunchyroll. But I'd highly suggest you pick up the original light novel instead and for several reasons.

## Why you should read the light novel
The show and the manga of Classroom of the elite are directly being adapted from the light novel and apart from the access to the original main plot, here are some important reasons you should instead steer towards the light novel particularly if you are watching the show and feeling something is off. This explanations won't include any spoiler throughout this article.

1. The show being rushed.
2. The lack of perspective different from the main character.
3. The depth of the main character not being explored.
4. The additional situations

### 1. The show being rushed
This issue is more noticeable if you are watching the third (3rd) saison. The Classroom of the elite saison span other only a maximum of 13 episodes and compacting a story mostly driven by its characters and their interaction in those small number is really a big challenge. 

The studio Lerche is really doing a great job to captivate the audience but for people having an experience with the light novel, a lot of the magic is missing. Classroom of the elite shines but its complex and interesting characters, their interactions with each other and the growth and changements they experience throughout the story.

It's all those small situations that they faced and how they reation to those obstacles that slowly build our connection with them. Thus those inner between obstacles being "skipped" strip the show watchers from the opportunity to get to know most of the other characters.

The show spend most of it times on the main characters, but Classroom of the elite is not just about the main characters, it's about the struggle of every student to reach the class A.

The show has to get to a climax at every saisons in order to be memorable so it's understandable why it is being rushed, but by plonging yourself in the light novel, you may find yourself connecting more with different characters and even rooting for them to get to the class A instead of the main characters.


### 2. The lack of different perspectives
If you watched the show, you will notice that almost everything is from the perspective of the main character Ayanokoji. It makes sense to be focused on the main character, but in the case of Classroom of the elite, an important aspect is being withdrawned. The different dynamics, schemes and internal conflict are what created the depth of the characters. Different character have different motivations and situations they struggle with and act accordingly.

We often in the light novel are left with some of those characters and their inner thoughts leading us to have a better understanding of them. This can lead us to emphasize with them or even hate them and witnessing their interactions with other characters gives us a context that we unfortunately do not have in the show.

It sometimes those little subtleties in a scene that makes it so memorable and impactful. Seing the character just act according to a script without any context may lead to disconnect from them.

This is one area that the light novel with its liberty allows us to enjoy.


### 3. Ayanokoji Depth
This must be sounding strange with all the emphasis I put on the show being stuck on Ayakonoji perspective but still we are not really interacting with the real Ayanokoji in the show.

We are in the same situation as the other characters, we are simply seeing what Ayanokoji wants us to see. 

We donâ€™t get his inner thoughts, the motivations to certain things he does, the single lens we have is his dialogue and his actions.

In the light novel. Ayanokoji actions have a clear overall goal. 

The character is on bigger quest that it may seem and seing his different actions and strategies given this background makes us understand on a deeper level.


### 4. In between
Classroom of the elite is not just this stressful anime thriller were every move needs to be precicly calculated and lead to the best outcome possible. The characters are just students, so sometimes they have little stories going on covering friendships, love stories and minor conflicts.

Those stories are take place sometimes during the school year but moreover during the break where we get to different sides of the characters in a totally different shade.

The anime doesn't have the luxury to spend time on those situation, but if you value the life of the characters outside of the stressful and serious setting, the light novel might cover that for you.

## Conclusion
